//Sparse Checkout allows for you to work on a smaller portion of a github repository without having to download
//the full thing. It can be done like this:

git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse <repository-url> 

--filter=blob:none prevents downloading file contents initially, which saves some time. 
--sparse prepares the repository for selecting a smaller section.


//Once you do this, cd into the directory that was just made for you.

cd <repository-directory>


git sparse-checkout set <path/to/your/folder>

//For example, LeetCode would simply be LeetCode, while something more specific would be LeetCode/AddTwoNumbers. Make
sure it's relative to the base directory.


git checkout <branch-name>

//Most of the time, this should automatically be set to main. If you made another branch, then repace <branch-name> 
//with it.


//Now, in order to push these changes you make, you'll have to add them.

git sparse-checkout add <added-content>

//For example, LeetCode/RemoveElement is a folder that I added.


git add -A

//This stages everything you've added. If you only want to add certain things, then replace -A with the folder you
want to add.


git status 

//This is used to verify what you're adding.


git commit -m ["optional message"]


git push
