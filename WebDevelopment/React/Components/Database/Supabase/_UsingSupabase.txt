Supabase is a really good free online database. I've been using it a lot for basically everything when I need a database. 

To use Supabase, first make an account.

Next, run this in the terminal to install it. Normally, run this in the directory that you would be creating the website:

npm install @supabase/supabase-js

The rest will be explained in the supabase.js file.
