To begin using React, start by using Vite.

To begin this, run this in the terminal at the folder "React":

npm create vite@latest

After this, go through the prompts and select "React" when asked. 
Most of these will use JavaScript. 


If you're taking this from the repository, run this:

npm i

This will install all dependancies. 


This react project will be using tailwindcss. Please direct to the Tailwind folder to learn how to install it.
