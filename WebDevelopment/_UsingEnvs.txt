.env files are environment variables. These variables are supposed to be hidden and not shared. 

There are a few different ways to access these variables.

// JavaScript //

Run: npm install dotenv

Wherever you're going to read a env variable, declare this first:

const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

Then, use:

process.env.ENV_NAME

This will read the env variable with that given name.
