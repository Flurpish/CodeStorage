Tailwind is used to quickly apply CSS styles in html without having to make CSS style blocks.

To begin using Tailwind, start by using Vite.

Go through the prompt for this in terminal at the root of your project:

npm create vite@latest


Once completed, run this:

npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite


In the vite.config.js/ts, add this import to the top:

import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'


Inside of the defineConfig function, add tailwindcss() to the plugins to look like this:

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(), //this is being added.
  ],
})


Finally, add this import to your CSS sheets:

@import "tailwindcss";
